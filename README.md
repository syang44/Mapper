# Mapper
A Geographic Information System developed in C++ using EZGL and GTK for graphics and the OpenStreetMap database. It was developed in a team of 3 as a project for ECE297. I cannot distribute the code here due to academic integrity but I would be happy to show the code to individuals that are interested.
